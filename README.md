# 📚 Client_Server_Architecture

Developed a RESTful Bookstore API using Java and JAX-RS, with in-memory data structures to manage books, authors, customers, carts, and orders. Implemented full CRUD operations, custom exception handling, and tested endpoints using Postman. 🚀

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- ☕ Java 21
- 🛡️ JAX-RS (Jakarta RESTful Web Services)
- 📄 JSON for data representation
- 🧪 Postman for API testing
- 📦 Maven for project management

## ✨ Features
- 📚 Manage books, authors, customers, carts, and orders
- 🔄 Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality
- 🗂️ In-memory storage (no external database)
- ⚠️ Custom error handling with proper HTTP responses
- 🏗️ Well-structured code with `model`, `service`, and `resource` layers
- 🧹 Dummy data initialization for easy testing

## 🚀 How to Run
1. 🔥 Clone the repository.
2. ⚙️ Build the project using Maven.
3. 🌐 Deploy the API on Apache Tomcat or run using an embedded server (e.g., Grizzly).
4. 🧪 Use Postman to test all available endpoints.

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ CRUD operations for books, authors, customers
- 🛒 Cart operations (add/remove items)
- 📦 Order placement and retrieval
- ❌ Custom error scenarios tested (e.g., resource not found)
